## Executive Summary

This project extends Assignment 1, predicting revenue generated by each customer based on Google Analytics data. The primary goal is to analyze observational data, featuring our target 'Revenue', list of features 'X', and our experiment 'T'. The experiment T refers to the referral program. Using EconML, CausalML, and DoWhy, we investigate the effects of the referral program on revenue generation to form a business strategy on how much the company should focus on the referral program.

- **H0:** Referral has no impact on revenue generation.
- **H1:** Referral does impact revenue generation.

**Conclusion:** The referral program is highly effective in increasing generated revenue compared to non-referral instances. The Null Hypothesis was rejected, and statistical techniques quantified the degree of impact of the referral program on revenue generation. EconML and CausalML are used to examine these hypotheses.

**Note:** Please skip to Section 4 to bypass EDA and business insights from Assignment 1.

- **Target:** Revenue generated
- **Treatment:** Boolean of referral
- **Feature Matrix:** All final predictors except Target and Treatment

Detailed exploratory analysis to derive business insights.

### 2.7 Type of Data Analysis

**Predictive Analysis:** Prediction of revenue generation by customer.

### 2.8 Categorical Encodings

Applying one-hot and label encoding to categorical variables.

## Section 4 - Causal Inference

### 4.1 Feature Importances

Analyzing feature importances from the predictive model.

### 4.2 A Tale of Referral's Impact on Revenue Using EconML

Testing the causal effect of the referral program on revenue while controlling for other factors.

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No causal effect of the referral program on revenue.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Causal effect of the referral program on revenue.

### 4.3 CausalML - Analysis of Referral Program Impact on Revenue Generation

#### Hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The referral program has no significant impact on revenue generation.
- **Alternate Hypothesis (Ha):** The referral program has a significant impact on revenue generation.

### Overview

Investigating the effectiveness of the referral program on revenue generation using predictive models (Linear Regression, XGBoost) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE).

### Predictive Performance Metrics

- **RMSE:** Lower RMSE indicates better predictive accuracy.
  - **Control:** 0.8686
  - **Treatment:** 0.8717

- **sMAPE:** Lower sMAPE indicates closer alignment between predicted and actual revenue.
  - **Control:** 0.1764
  - **Treatment:** 0.1678

- **Gini Coefficient:** Higher Gini coefficients indicate better discrimination power.
  - **Control:** 0.7125
  - **Treatment:** 0.5977

### Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

- **Linear Regression:**
  - **ATE:** 0.27
  - **Confidence Interval:** [0.19, 0.34]
  - **Interpretation:** Referred customers generated 0.27 units more revenue.

- **XGBoost:**
  - **ATE:** 0.24
  - **Confidence Interval:** [0.22, 0.27]
  - **Interpretation:** Referred customers generated 0.24 units more revenue.

### Conclusion

Both Linear Regression and XGBoost indicate a positive average treatment effect of the referral program on revenue generation.

### Recommendations

Further investigate the reasons for differences in ATE estimates between models. Conduct sensitivity analyses and validate results with additional datasets.

### Visualizations

Graphs depicting revenue distributions, predictive performance metrics, and ATE estimates enhance understanding.

### 4.4 Meta Learner Comparison

Analyzing results based on estimated Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and distribution of Individual Treatment Effects (ITE).

1. **S-Learner:**
   - **ATE Estimate:** 0.268
   - **Confidence Interval:** [0.193, 0.343]
   - **Business Meaning:** Consistent positive impact of referrals on revenue.

2. **T-Learner:**
   - **ATE Estimate:** 0.201
   - **Confidence Interval:** [0.176, 0.226]
   - **Business Meaning:** Positive impact with higher variability.

3. **X-Learner (with propensity score):**
   - **ATE Estimate:** 0.136
   - **Confidence Interval:** [0.113, 0.158]
   - **Business Meaning:** Positive impact, moderate variability.

4. **X-Learner (without propensity score):**
   - **ATE Estimate:** -0.000
   - **Confidence Interval:** [-0.017, 0.017]
   - **Business Meaning:** No significant treatment effect without propensity scores.

### Conclusion

The S-Learner provides a robust estimate of the treatment effect, suggesting that 'Referral' has a positive impact on revenue. The results should be interpreted cautiously, considering the assumptions and limitations of each learner.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different causal models and compare performance.
- Implement analysis on a larger dataset and optimize for scalability.
- Integrate real-time data streams for continuous monitoring and analysis of referral program impacts.
