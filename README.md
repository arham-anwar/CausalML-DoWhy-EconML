1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Impact of Referral Program on Revenue Generation.ipynb`

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Causal Machine Learning Analysis
5. Visualization of Results

## Key Findings

1. Referred customers have a significantly higher average order value compared to non-referred customers.
2. The difference in average order value between referred and non-referred customers is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05).
3. Referred customers contribute more to the overall revenue despite being a smaller portion of the customer base.
4. Causal machine learning techniques confirm the positive impact of the referral program on order values.

## Causal Machine Learning Techniques

We employed several causal machine learning techniques to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the referral program:

1. S-learner (Single-model learner):
   The S-learner uses a single model to estimate both the outcome and treatment effect. It combines the treatment indicator with other features to predict the outcome. The ATE is then calculated as the average difference between predicted outcomes with and without treatment.

2. T-learner (Two-model learner):
   The T-learner uses two separate models: one for treated units and one for control units. It estimates the outcome for each group independently and then calculates the ATE as the difference between these estimates.

3. X-learner:
   The X-learner is a more advanced method that combines the strengths of both S and T learners. It first estimates individual treatment effects using both models, then uses these estimates to improve the final treatment effect estimation.

All three methods consistently estimated an ATE of $59.74, which aligns with our initial statistical analysis. This consistency across different causal inference techniques strengthens our confidence in the positive impact of the referral program.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to support the findings:

1. Distribution of Order Values for Referred vs Non-Referred Customers
2. Average Order Value Comparison
3. Total Revenue Contribution
4. Time Series of Order Values

## Conclusion

The referral program demonstrates a significant positive impact on revenue generation. Referred customers consistently show higher order values and contribute disproportionately to overall revenue. Both traditional statistical methods and advanced causal machine learning techniques support this conclusion, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the referral program.

## Future Work

1. Analyze the long-term value of referred customers (e.g., customer lifetime value)
2. Investigate the cost-effectiveness of the referral program
3. Explore factors influencing the success of referrals
4. Conduct cohort analysis to understand how referral impact changes over time
5. Implement more advanced causal inference techniques, such as causal forests or double machine learning
6. Explore heterogeneous treatment effects to identify subgroups where the referral program is most effective
